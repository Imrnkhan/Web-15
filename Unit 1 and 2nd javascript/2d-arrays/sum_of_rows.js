/*
You are given a 2D array, whose dimensions are stored in two variables with the nameNandM

The value stored inNdenotes the number of rows, and the value inMdenotes the number of columns

The 2D array is stored in a variable with the namearr

You have to print the sum of all elements in a row, on a new line

For example, consider the value stored inN = 3,M = 2, and the array isarr = [1,2],[3,4],[5,6], then the required output will be

3 (Adding the elements of the row [1,2])
7 (Adding the elements of the row [3,4])
11(Adding the elements of the row [5,6])

Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inNandM

The nextNlines containMvalues each denoting the value stored inarr


Output
Print the sum of each row, on a new line. You have to do this for all rows of the matrix

Sample Input 1 

3 2
1 2 
3 4
5 6
Sample Output 1

3
7
11
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 3,M = 2, and the array isarr = [1,2],[3,4],[5,6], then the required output will be

3 (Adding the elements of the row [1,2])
7 (Adding the elements of the row [3,4])
11(Adding the elements of the row [5,6])
