<!-- Try Call, apply, bind exercise

- Every Teacher, Player and Student is a person.

- Can we create a blueprint of person and use them in other blueprints of Teacher, Player and Student.

 

function Person(n, a) {
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
  }

  function Teacher(s, n, a) {
    Person.call(this, n, a);
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
    this.subject = s;
  }

  function Student(s, n, a) {
    Person.apply(this, [n, a]);
    this.name = n;
    this.age = a;
    this.subject = s;
  }
  function Player(s, n, a) {
    var x = Person.bind(this, n, a);
    x();
    this.sport = s;
  }

  var teacher1 = new Teacher("Physics", "Rahul", 26);

  var player1 = new Player("Cricket", "Virat", 30);

  var student1 = new Player("Js", "Tushar", 19);
 

     console.log("student1:", student1);

  console.log(player1);

  <!-- Difference between Call, Apply and Bind
- Apply will be used if you need array as an argument.

- Bind can be used in conditional statements.

- Above code has applications of call, apply and bind. The difference is explained there itself.

 

Summary of this

Default Binding - Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object.
Implicit Binding - In a method, this refers to the owner object.
Explicit Binding - Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.
New Binding -  Using a constructor function  -->
